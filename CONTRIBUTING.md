# Adding to this repo

Use the normal [GitHub workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to add your links to this repo

Once your cohort has discussed the morning challenge:
1. Update the README.md with the name of the morning challenge and a link to the repo, for ease of access later  
(Week 1 has been done for you)

2. Add a link to your solution
You may want to change `Solution 1` to the names of the pair who worked on it, for ease of access.

Add as many solutions as you like :smile:
